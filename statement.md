Project Statement

1. Problem Description
The goal is to solve the analytical geometry problem of finding a point's reflection across a 3D plane. We need a reliable tool that not only performs the necessary vector-based calculation but also provides a clear, interactive visual confirmation of the result. This addresses the challenge of visualizing abstract 3D transformations.

2. Project Scope
The project is focused entirely on the calculation and 3D plotting of a single point reflection. It is an independent, command-line application.
- What is included: Point and plane definition input, calculation of the reflected point, and 3D visualization.
- What is not included: Any form of GUI, web implementation, handling of multiple points, or reflection of other geometric objects (lines, spheres, etc.).

3. Target Users
This project is mainly aimed at:
- Students studying 3D geometry or linear algebra for educational verification.
- Teachers who need a simple visual aid for demonstrating the reflection concept.

4. High-Level Features
A. Parameter Input: User defines the point P and the plane coefficients a, b, c, d.
B. Calculation Engine: Determines the exact reflected coordinates P'.
C. Visualization: Renders the entire scene (P, P', and the plane) in a 3D plot for spatial analysis.
